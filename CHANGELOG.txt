MIP SDK Change Log - update with each release

The version number scheme in MIP SDK is as follows:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

The MAJOR version is incremented when changes are made (to the public interface) that are not backwards compatible.
The MINOR version is incremented when a new feature is added (to the public interface) or a current feature is improved upon.
The PATCH version is incremented when a bug is fixed or a small change is made.

Major revisions will specify what caused the non-backwards compatible change. These will be specified like so:
CHANGED - A non-backwards compatible change was made to an existing function/class.
RENAMED - A function/class has been renamed.
REMOVED - A function/class has been removed.
